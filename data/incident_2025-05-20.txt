Title: 503 Errors on auth-api
Date: 2025-05-20

Impact:
Users were unable to authenticate between 10:42 AM and 11:17 AM UTC.

Root Cause:
The auth-api service failed due to a misconfigured Envoy proxy which blocked all incoming traffic. The CPU also spiked due to retries.

Resolution:
Rolled back to a previous Envoy config. Restarted the service and monitored CPU load.

Follow-up:
Improve config validation. Add CPU and health checks to CI/CD gates.
